\section{Answers to the Questions}
Q-A: If we cannot modify anything on the server side, it could be possible to use a servlet that executes a C code which communicate with the RPC server. To do this we could use the Java Native Interface (JNI), that is a programming framework that enables Java code running in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to call native applications and libraries written in other languages such as C, C++ and assembly.

Q-B: The choice depends on the quantity of static page content. Often, dynamic pages are mostly static with a lot of static information. If the dynamic parts inside are few, using CGI we are obliged to write many static print statements. If we are in a situation like this, it's better to design pages by writing static HTML documents with pieces of code inside(PHP).

Q-C: It could be used, but only for short files. In fact, the file has to be url_encoded and depending on the browser or on the web server implementation, the URL could be roughly limited to a certain amount of characters. A client could send huge files to the server so we cannot use only the HTTP GET method. In addition, lots of time will be spent to url_encode the file and at destination to url_decode it, resulting on a big latency for the client and in lots of work for the server. As last thing, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe", so for idempotent requests.

Q-D: The main advantage of this approach is that it prevents some duplicate form submissions. This is really useful, because when a web form is submitted to a server through an HTTP POST request, a web user that attempts to refresh the server response in certain user agents can cause the contents of the original HTTP POST request to be resubmitted, possibly causing undesired results, such as a duplicate web purchase. We want to prevent a paper to be submitted more than one time because it causes useless work on the server side. We also want to prevent a person to send more than one booking request because it cause a wrong decrease of available rooms.
